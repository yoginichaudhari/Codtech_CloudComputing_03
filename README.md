Simulated Multi-Cloud Architecture Using Replit (No Real AWS/GCP Used)

Since I do not have access to a credit or debit card, I couldn't activate real cloud services like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, which require billing info even for free-tier usage.

🔁 Instead, I have simulated a multi-cloud environment within Replit using a simple data.json file to act as cloud responses.
